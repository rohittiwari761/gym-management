Dear {gym_owner.user.get_full_name()},

This is an automated notification from your Gym Management System.

The following members have expired memberships and have been automatically deactivated:

{member_list}

Total expired members: {len(expired_members)}

Please contact these members to renew their memberships or take appropriate action.

You can reactivate members by:
1. Creating a new payment for the member
2. Manually updating their membership expiry date

Best regards,
