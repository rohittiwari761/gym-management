# Membership Management & Notification System üéØ

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Automatic Membership Extension on Payment** üí≥
**Location**: `gym_backend/gym_api/views.py` - `MembershipPaymentViewSet.perform_create()`

**How it works**:
- When a payment is created through the app, the system automatically extends the member's membership
- **If membership is still valid**: Extends from current expiry date
- **If membership is expired**: Starts from today
- **Reactivates member**: Sets `is_active = True` if member was deactivated
- **Updates MemberSubscription**: Creates or updates subscription records

**Example**:
```python
# Member expires on 2025-07-15, payment for 3 months created on 2025-07-10
# New expiry: 2025-07-15 + 90 days = 2025-10-13

# Member expired on 2025-07-05, payment for 2 months created on 2025-07-10  
# New expiry: 2025-07-10 + 60 days = 2025-09-08
```

### 2. **Automatic Member Deactivation** üîí
**Location**: `gym_backend/gym_api/management/commands/deactivate_expired_members.py`

**Features**:
- **Management Command**: `python manage.py deactivate_expired_members`
- **Dry Run Mode**: `--dry-run` to test without making changes
- **Email Notifications**: `--send-notifications` to email gym owners
- **Automatic Deactivation**: Sets `is_active = False` for expired members
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all actions

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test what would be deactivated
python manage.py deactivate_expired_members --dry-run

# Deactivate expired members and send notifications
python manage.py deactivate_expired_members --send-notifications

# Just deactivate without email
python manage.py deactivate_expired_members
```
