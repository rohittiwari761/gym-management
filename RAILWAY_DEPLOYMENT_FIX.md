# 🚂 Railway Backend Deployment Issue

## ❌ Current Problem
Your Railway backend at `gym-management-production-4343.up.railway.app` is **not accessible**.

**Error**: `Could not resolve host: gym-management-production-4343.up.railway.app`

## 🔍 Diagnosis
The Railway deployment is either:
1. **Down/Crashed** - Service stopped running
2. **URL Changed** - Railway assigned a new URL
3. **Project Deleted** - Railway project was removed
4. **Billing Issue** - Railway free tier limits exceeded

## 🚀 Solutions

### Option 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Find your gym management project
3. Check deployment status
4. Look for the current URL (may have changed)
5. Check logs for errors

### Option 2: Redeploy to Railway
If the project exists but is down:

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd gym_backend

# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway link [your-project-id]
railway up
```

### Option 3: Create New Railway Deployment
If the project was deleted:

```bash
cd gym_backend

# Create new Railway project
railway login
railway init
railway add postgresql  # If you need database
railway up

# Note the new URL and update frontend
```

### Option 4: Alternative - Use Local Backend
For testing, you can run backend locally:

```bash
cd gym_backend
python manage.py runserver
```

Then update frontend to use `http://localhost:8000/api` (mobile only)

## 🔧 Frontend URL Update Needed

Once you have the new Railway URL, update these files:

### 1. Update SecurityConfig
`gym_frontend/lib/security/security_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String _prodApiUrl = 'https://YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api';
```

### 2. Update WebApiService  
`gym_frontend/lib/services/web_api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String primaryUrl = 'https://YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api';
```

### 3. Update Login Screen Info
`gym_frontend/lib/screens/login_screen.dart` (around line 254):
```dart
'Connected to: YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app'
```

## 🎯 Quick Test
To test if a Railway URL works:
```bash
curl -I https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/
```

Should return HTTP 200 or redirect, not "Could not resolve host"

## 🆘 Need Help?
1. **Check Railway logs** for error messages
2. **Look at Railway billing** - may have hit free tier limits  
3. **Verify Railway project** still exists in dashboard
4. **Share the new Railway URL** once you find it

The web app will work perfectly once the backend URL is corrected! 🎉
