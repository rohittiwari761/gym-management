# 🚨 Railway URL Down - Emergency Fix

## 🔥 **Critical Issue**
```
ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED: gym-management-production-2168.up.railway.app
```

**The Railway URL is completely unreachable!** DNS resolution failed, meaning the service is down or deleted.

## 🛠️ **Immediate Actions Required**

### **Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Look for your gym-management project
3. **Check if the service still exists**

### **Step 2: If Service Exists - Redeploy**
```bash
railway login
railway status
railway up
```

### **Step 3: If Service Missing - Create New Railway Service**
```bash
railway login
railway new
# Select your gym-management project
railway up
```

### **Step 4: Get New Railway URL**
After deployment, Railway will give you a new URL like:
```
https://gym-management-production-XXXX.up.railway.app
```

## 🔧 **Update Frontend with New URL**

### **Update Web API Service**
Edit `gym_frontend/lib/services/web_api_service.dart`:

```dart
// Replace line 8 with your new Railway URL
static const String primaryUrl = 'https://YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api';
```

### **Update Debug API Service**
Edit `gym_frontend/lib/services/debug_api_service.dart` (if exists):

```dart
// Update the Railway URL
static const String railwayUrl = 'https://YOUR-NEW-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api';
```

## 🚀 **Quick Deploy Script**

Create this script to redeploy everything:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🚀 Redeploying Railway service..."

# 1. Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway up

# 2. Get new URL
echo "📋 Copy your new Railway URL from the output above"
echo "🔧 Update gym_frontend/lib/services/web_api_service.dart"
echo "🔧 Update primaryUrl with your new Railway URL"

# 3. Redeploy frontend
cd gym_frontend
flutter build web
# Deploy to Netlify (your usual process)
```

## 🎯 **Environment Variables to Set**

Make sure these are set in your new Railway deployment:

```bash
railway variables --set "GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
railway variables --set "GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
railway variables --set "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=gym_backend.settings_production"
```

## 🔍 **Check Railway Status**

**Option 1: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway status
railway logs
```

**Option 2: Railway Dashboard**
- Check project status
- View deployment logs
- Get new URL

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Check Railway dashboard** - Is your service still there?
2. **Redeploy if needed** - Use Railway CLI or dashboard
3. **Get new URL** - Copy the new Railway URL
4. **Update frontend** - Update `web_api_service.dart`
5. **Test** - Try your Netlify app again

**Your Railway service needs to be redeployed!** This is likely due to Railway maintenance or service expiration. 🚨
