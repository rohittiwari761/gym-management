# Attendance History Date Filtering Fix

## Problem
The attendance history tab was not honoring date filters. When selecting historical dates where users were not present, the system was still showing them as present. This was causing confusion between historical data and current attendance data.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `SecureHttpClient._makeRequestWithFallback()` method in `/gym_frontend/lib/security/secure_http_client.dart`. On line 234, the method was calling `_buildSecureUri(endpoint, null)` instead of passing the actual query parameters, causing date filters to be lost in transit to the backend API.

## Solution
Fixed the HTTP client to properly pass query parameters:

### 1. Updated method signature
```dart
Future<http.Response> _makeRequestWithFallback(
  String method,
  String endpoint,
  Map<String, String> headers,
  String? body,
  Duration timeout,
  Map<String, dynamic>? queryParams, // Added query parameters
) async {
```

### 2. Fixed primary URL building
```dart
// Before (incorrect):
final uri = _buildSecureUri(endpoint, null);

// After (correct):
final uri = _buildSecureUri(endpoint, queryParams);
```

### 3. Fixed fallback URL handling
```dart
// Added query parameter handling for fallback URLs
if (queryParams != null && queryParams.isNotEmpty) {
  final sanitizedParams = _sanitizeQueryParams(queryParams);
  uri = uri.replace(queryParameters: sanitizedParams);
}
```

### 4. Updated method call
```dart
// Updated the call to pass query parameters
final response = await _makeRequestWithFallback(
  method,
  endpoint,
  secureHeaders,
  jsonBody,
  timeout,
  queryParams, // Now passes the actual query parameters
);
```

## Impact
- ✅ Date filtering now works correctly in attendance history
- ✅ Historical dates show only data from that specific date
- ✅ No more confusion between current and historical attendance data
- ✅ API calls now properly include query parameters
- ✅ Backend logging shows correct date parameters being received

## Files Modified
1. `/gym_frontend/lib/security/secure_http_client.dart` - Fixed query parameter handling

## Testing
The fix ensures that when a user selects a date like "2025-07-08" in the attendance history tab, the Flutter app will:
1. Properly format the date parameter
2. Include it in the HTTP request query parameters
3. Send it to the Django backend
4. Receive only attendance data from that specific date

This resolves the issue where historical dates were showing current attendance data instead of historical data.
