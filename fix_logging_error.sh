âœ… Critical Fix:
- Removed file-based logging that requires /var/log/gym_app/ directory
- Changed to console-only logging for Railway environment
- All logs now go to stdout/stderr (visible in Railway dashboard)
- Fixed PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied

ðŸš€ Logging Fix:
- Django will now start successfully on Railway
- No more permission denied errors for log files
- All logging visible in Railway deployment logs
- Health check should pass after this fix"

# Push to GitHub (triggers Railway re-deployment)
git push origin main
