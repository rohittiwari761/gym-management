# 🔧 CORS Fix for Netlify Communication

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**
Your Netlify app (`benevolent-gingersnap-155623.netlify.app`) was blocked by CORS policy:

```
Request header field strict-transport-security is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **Added Missing Headers to Backend**
Updated `gym_backend/settings_production.py` to include:
- `strict-transport-security` (the main culprit)
- `sec-fetch-site`, `sec-fetch-mode`, `sec-fetch-dest`
- `referer`, `cache-control`, `pragma`

## 🚀 **Required: Deploy to Railway**

The fix is now in GitHub, but you need to deploy to Railway:

### **Option 1: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway login
railway up
```

### **Option 2: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your project: `gym-management-production-2168`
3. Go to **Deployments** → **Deploy Latest**

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment**

### **Test 1: CORS Preflight**
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://gym-management-production-2168.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/ \
  -H "Origin: https://benevolent-gingersnap-155623.netlify.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: strict-transport-security" \
  -v
```
*Should return the header in `access-control-allow-headers`*

### **Test 2: Your Netlify App**
- Go to your Netlify app
- Try Google Sign-In
- Should work without CORS errors

## 📋 **Complete Fix Status**

- ✅ **CORS Headers**: Fixed `strict-transport-security` issue
- ✅ **Google OAuth Diagnostics**: Enhanced logging added
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Need to verify on Railway
- ⏳ **Deployment**: Waiting for Railway deployment

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy to Railway** (critical step)
2. **Test Google Sign-In** in your Netlify app
3. **Check diagnostic endpoint**: `/api/auth/google/config/`
4. **Verify no CORS errors** in browser console

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

After deployment, your Netlify app should:
- ✅ Connect to Railway backend without CORS errors
- ✅ Send Google tokens successfully
- ✅ Complete Google Sign-In flow

The combination of CORS fix + proper Google OAuth environment variables should resolve both issues! 🚀
